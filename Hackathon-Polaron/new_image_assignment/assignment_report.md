# New-image batch assignment — ALL CALLS: "CAN'T TELL"

**Status correction (acquisition analysis, 2026-10-04):** each new
photo's frame height occurs in only one batch's acquisition group, and
each call followed that session — the assignments cannot separate
batch-match from session-match. The protocol (predictions saved blind
before any ground truth) is kept and remains the right pattern; the
verdicts are relabelled **"can't tell"** until session-controlled data
exists. Do not quote the assigned column below as material evidence.

Method (v2): primary rule = envelope coverage — count of the 9 declared features inside each batch's observed min-max range (unbiased by batch spread). Exactly one batch containing 9/9 => that batch; several => inconclusive; none => best coverage wins unless median robust-z >2.5 => out-of-distribution. Median-z kept as a secondary score (it favours wide batches — see `medianz_winner` in assignments.csv). Recipe frozen on Batch_3 (`validated_comparison/recipe.json`).

| image | assigned (superseded) | inside env. (B1/B2/B3) | median-z best | confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| img_3e122cbj | Batch_1 → can't tell | 7/3/3 | Batch_1 2.20 | best envelope coverage 7/9 — session-matched (group 2316 = B1-only session) |
| img_fn0mhxef | Batch_2 → can't tell | 8/9/8 | Batch_1 0.38 | 9/9 envelope — session-matched (group 2048 = B2-only session) |
| img_xrv9xvzb | Batch_3 → can't tell | 6/7/9 | Batch_1 0.66 | 9/9 envelope — session-matched (group 2088 = B3-only session) |

## Caveats

- Assignment is similarity, not provenance: batches overlap on every feature, so weak-confidence calls are expected for images near the overlap region.
- With 7 images in Batch_1/2 and 17 in Batch_3, envelope estimates are noisy; scores carry that uncertainty.
- The frozen recipe segments BSE only; InLens/ETD channels are recorded but not used (channel comparability not yet established).
## Corrected labels (organizer feedback, recorded without retroactive success)

Original blind predictions are preserved above. Confirmed truth:

| image | predicted | truth (confirmed) | correct |
|---|---|---|---|
| img_3e122cbj | Batch_1 | **Batch_2** | no |
| img_fn0mhxef | Batch_2 | **Batch_1** | no |
| img_xrv9xvzb | Batch_3 | apparently Batch_3 (unconfirmed) | likely |

**Score: 0/2 on explicitly confirmed corrections; 1/3 if xrv is
confirmed.** The secondary median-z score would have assigned fn→B1
(correct) — neither score is consistently right.

This failure was flagged in advance: every prediction carried
`cant_tell_session_matched` — each new image's frame-height group
appeared in exactly one batch, so session signature and batch label were
confounded by construction. The disclosed labels do not resolve whether
the envelope saw material or session. These images are now unblinded
diagnostic cases; any further method changes informed by them require a
new untouched test set for independent validation.

The submitted 76.4% / 79.6% / 97.8% scores are external-submission
numbers (TeamJester-style distance-softmax features), not produced by
this envelope pipeline — coverage/scores here are not accuracy claims.
