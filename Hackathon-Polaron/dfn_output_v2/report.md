# micro2dfn — microstructure markers & DFN consequence report

**What this is.** SEM cross-section photos of a silicon–graphite battery anode were colour-coded into three materials — pores (black), graphite (grey), silicon (bright) — using **one shared set of brightness cutoffs** for every photo, so no batch can re-calibrate itself into looking normal. From those maps we measured ~30 structural markers per image, then fed them into the standard PyBaMM Doyle–Fuller–Newman battery model as consequence *indicators*.

**Honesty rules.** Numbers are reported as batch *differences* with 95% CIs — the defensible signal. Absolute DFN outputs carry stated assumptions and are illustrative. Nothing here predicts cycle life or guarantees failure. Every value traces back to a marker, a formula, and an overlay image.

## Photo-quality check

**2 low-contrast photos flagged** — silicon may be over-counted in them (the object classifier separates classified Si particles from uncertain-bright material; check the overlays):

- `Batch_1/img_4ih2ggld` (si_bulk_contrast=1.78, bright_fine_frac=0.081)
- `Batch_1/img_5n1q8atc` (si_bulk_contrast=1.93, bright_fine_frac=0.081)

## Segmentation settings (frozen)

- Shared thresholds: `t_pore=0.7109`, `t_si=1.3354` — fitted on the baseline batch **Batch_3** only, saved in `recipe.json`, and reused verbatim on later runs. A newly added batch can never change how existing batches are measured; `run_manifest.json` records the recipe md5, code md5s and every input image md5 for this exact run.
- Si/bright-fine classifier cutoff: `t_core=1.550` (5th percentile interior brightness of large, compact particles, calibrated on baseline objects only).
- Resolution floor: Si objects < 150 px and pores < 20 px (~0.35 um) are merged into bulk — same rule for every image.
- **Cached measurements reused** (`--reuse`): markers and objects loaded from `markers_all.csv`/`objects_all.csv` written by the run recorded in `run_manifest.json`.

## Batch differences

No pair–marker difference survives Benjamini–Hochberg correction (FDR 0.10).

Nominal (uncorrected) p<0.05 count: 1 of 51 tests — compare against ~2.6 expected by chance. `mdd` is the smallest median difference detectable at ~5%: smaller observed gaps are under-powered, not proven absent. These are UNBLOCKED tests — acquisition session can organise them; the stratified within-session test is in `build_report.py` (`blocked_permutation.csv`).

All pairwise differences are in `batch_differences.csv`.

## DFN consequence indicators

**Plain conclusion.** Paired same-seed comparisons (same cathode at each sweep index for every batch) shift predicted cycle-5 discharge capacity by Batch_1-Batch_3 +0.197 Ah; Batch_2-Batch_3 +0.15 Ah; Batch_1-Batch_2 +0.0834 Ah — while the swept assumptions alone shift it by ~1.13 Ah (pooled IQR). Judged against the declared up-front thresholds and the paired ranges: 1 of 12 pair-indicator differences are meaningful, 6 sit fully below threshold, the rest are inconclusive. Lithium loss and capacity retention are reported only as diagnostics — they cannot move measurably in 5 cycles and are not part of the comparison. Pore-count differences are image findings only — they are not a DFN input and the model verdict does not cover them. See `dfn_paired_differences.csv` for every verdict.

Convergence: Batch_1 17/17; Batch_2 17/17; Batch_3 17/17 runs.
Plating (reversed rule): a run dipping below 0 V anode surface potential counts as a warning ONLY where the reference cell under the same protocol stays >= 0 V; if the reference also dips, sub-zero is a protocol/geometry artefact and is not attributed to any batch. Per-run warning counts are in `dfn_paired_differences.csv` (`plating_warnings_*`); reference min = 0.011473244183745793 V — see `dfn_validation.md`.

## Not measurable from these images

Binder distribution (no BSE contrast), SEI layer, lithium inventory, 3-D pore connectivity / electrolyte wetting (2-D sections only — see the optional reconstruction branch), foil corrosion.

**Note on tortuosity.** In every image the resolved pore network does not form a connected path across the section, so a diffusion-solve tortuosity cannot be measured on 2-D cuts — the through-plane network lives largely in sub-resolution pores. Directional markers (pore anisotropy, geodesic proxy, Bruggeman-equivalent exponent) carry the usable signal.

## How every number was produced

```
BSE TIFF -> flat-field (Gaussian background)
  -> shared multi-Otsu thresholds (frozen to thresholds.json)
  -> watershed split + Si/bright-fine object classification
  -> per-image stereological markers (this report)
  -> per-batch median/IQR + bootstrap CIs
  -> PyBaMM DFN sweep over marker bands -> indicators
```
